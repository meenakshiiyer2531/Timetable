# Timetable Automation System

The Timetable Automation System is a Python-based web application designed to automate the scheduling of timetables for educational institutions. This system helps administrators create and manage timetables for classes, teachers, and rooms while reducing manual effort and errors.

This project includes both a backend API (built using Python) for generating timetables and handling updates, as well as a frontend for users to interact with and view their timetables.
